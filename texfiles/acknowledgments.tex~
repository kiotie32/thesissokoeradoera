This thesis would not have taken shape without the help and contribution from my well wishers. Thus, I would like to thank all who have contributed directly or indirectly in realizing this thesis. First of all, I want to thank my family, especially my parents, my wife, my son, my in-laws and my brother who have always been by my side and have inspired me and helped me in every possible way during my PhD. It was the dream of my parents that I pursue a career in research and earn a PhD. I sincerely thank them for nurturing such a dream and the support they provided to achieve it. No words of praise are enough for my wife, Runa, who took all the responsibilities of the family on herself while I was busy with my research. She has been my pillar of strength and motivation. I would like to earnestly thank her for being on my side at every moment. I would also like to thank my son Arya, who never complained about lack of enough interaction with his father but motivated me in my work. I would also like to thank my in-laws for providing me the mental support needed during my PhD work. 

 I thank IIT Kharagpur and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) for providing me with the opportunity of pursuing my PhD, along with research facilities which were of the very best quality. I am grateful to my  supervisor Prof. Indranil SenGupta, whose guidance and motivation made this thesis into a reality. He not only helped me with technical guidance on my research, but also taught the other aspects of research work. The knowledge gained from him helped me in every stage of my PhD career and at the same time developed me into a better individual. I sincerely thank Professor Chittaranjan Mandal, Dept. of CSE, IIT Kharagpur for mentoring me during my PhD work. He not only provided technical guidance but also helped me in improving the interaction skills. I would also like to thank Professor Sanatanu Chattopadhay, Dept. of E\&ECE, IIT Kharagpur for providing me an oppurtunity to work with him. He was kind enough to allow me to be a part of his research group and shared the tools with me. He was also responsible for improvement of my technical document writing skills.

I sincerely thank the undergraduate and graduate students who worked with me on various problems over the duration of my PhD -- Anurag Kayal, Dhawal Gadiya. I would also like to thank Soham and Bodhisatwa, students of Netaji Subhas Engineering college, who helped me in coding while working on one my research problems. I am particularly grateful to Subhadip Kundu and especially Kanchan Manna, for the help they provided during my PhD work. The discussions and interactions with them were very helpful and were resposible in determining the course of the PhD. I would like to thank my friends Arghya, Subhasis, Rishiraj, Subhasish, Sumanta and especially Dharmendra for making my stay at IIT Kharagpur a fun-filled and memorable one. I also express my sincere gratitude to the faculty members and staff of CSE, IIT Kharagpur.
