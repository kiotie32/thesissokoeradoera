\noindent Bibhas Ghoshal received M.Sc degree in Electronic Science from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, in 2002, and an M.E. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from West Bengal University of Technology in 2005. He has been pursuing Ph.D. at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, since January 2010. He was university topper in B.Sc examination and received merit award for excellence in M.Sc examination. Even though his Ph.D. is on Testing of NoC based memory systems, his general research interests include FPGA based system design, CAD for VLSI, Image Processing, Open source application development.
